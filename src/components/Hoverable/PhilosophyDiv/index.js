         In school I practiced art. I enjoyed the open ended quality, the endless
         thought that you could put into each piece. How it pushed your brain to
         not just think of one possibility, but to think of hundreds and critically
         analyze each. Experience in the restaurant industry, with it's pace and
         individual purpose, brought me an appreciation of real world application
         - combining my experience and natural curiousity, to allow myself to apply
         my creative thoughts in a different approach.
         <br />
         <br />
         I hope you find this detail, purpose, creativity, and thought within my projects.
