         In school I practiced art. I enjoyed the open ended quality, the endless
         thought that you could put into each piece. How it pushed your brain to
         not just think of one possibility, but to think of hundreds and critically
         analyze each. Experience in the restaurant industry, with it's pace and
         individual purpose, brought me an appreciation of real world application
         - combining my experience and natural curiousity, to allow myself to apply
         these creative thoughts in a more succinct approach.
         <br />
         <br />
         I hope you find my focus on detail, purpose, and thought within each of my projects.
