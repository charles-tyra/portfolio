         I practiced art in school. I enjoyed the open-ended quality; the endless
         thought that you could put into each piece; the way it pushed my brain to
         not just think of one possibility, but to think of hundreds and critically
         analyze each. My experience in the restaurant industry, with its pace and
         intentionality, brought me an appreciation of real-world application.
         It combined my natural curiosity with practical experience, allowing me to 
         translate creative thoughts to the functional and tangible.
         <br />
         <br />
         I hope you find my focus on detail, purpose, and thought within each of my projects.
